        <p class="about-me-p">
            My name is Jacob Walton. I'm from Kansas City, MO. My girlfriend and I have two crazy dogs, one is a shepard/mix (Cinco), and the other is a black lab (Rocko). All they ever want to do is play and eat. My passion is making music.
        </p> <br/>
        <p class="about-me-p">
           I've been producing music for almost 10 years and my music has taken me to a few different places around the country like Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Washington D.C, and more. I have no idea what else to type now. Lorem is pretty cool.
